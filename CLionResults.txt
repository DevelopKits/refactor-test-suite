Version CL-140-1221.2

Notes:

Methodology: Default suggestions are selected when refactoring.  Some
refactorings can be performed successfully if suggestions are excluded.

Add Block Delimiter is performed by selecting the code and performing
Code / Surround With... / {}.

Add Parameter is performed with Change Signature.

Create Setter Method is performed with Code / Generate... / Setter.

Flatten Conditional is performed by repeatedly applying the fixup Merge
Nested Ifs.

Introduce Local is performed with Extract Variable.

Introduce Constant is performed with Extract Constant.
