Notes:

Methodology: Default suggestions are selected when refactoring.  Some
refactorings can be performed successfully if suggestions are excluded.

Add Block Delimiter is performed by selecting the code and performing
Code / Surround With... / {}.

Add Parameter is performed with Change Signature.

Create Setter Method is performed with Code / Generate... / Setter.

Flatten Conditional is performed by repeatedly applying the fixup Merge
Nested Ifs.

Introduce Local is performed with Extract Variable.

Introduce Constant is performed with Extract Constant.

Replace If With Ternary Expression is performed by applying the fixup Replace
'if else' with '?:'.

Replace Ternary Expression With If is performed by applying the fixup Replace
'?;' with 'if else'.
